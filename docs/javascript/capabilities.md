# Capabilities

## Rendering and replacing components

The Customizations API allows developers to render predefined components on several sections of their sites. The premise of this API is to create a set of components that can be easily used and composed, in order to render additional components to certains sections of the page, and make these types of customizations as easy as possible, while reusing LumApps code and components.

In order to understand the possibilities that we have with this API, we need to first define the different elements that compose a `Customization`. These components are:
- **Target**: This is the component of the page that we want to use as reference for our customization. This can be considered as the X coordinate for where to place our customization, and there is a predefined list of components that are marked as targets.

- **Placement**: This is where we are going to add our customization around that target. This can be considered as the Y coordinate for our customization, and the possible values for this placement depend on the component to be customized. This placement usually goes from above, under, to the left or to the right of the component, with some components having the possibility to be entirely replaced. It is also worth mentioning that not all targets are compatible with the full list of placements depicted here. More information on this on the [components](#components) section.

![Placements](./assets/placements.png "Placements")

- **Component to render**: Basically this is what we want to render at the X and Y coordinates that we provided for target and placement.

As an example, inserting the following code in your LumApps site will display a message between the header and all pages:

```js
window.lumapps.customize(({ targets, components, render, session, placement, constants }) => {
    const { Message } = components;
    const { Kind } = constants;

    render({
        placement: placement.ABOVE,
        target: targets.PAGE,
        toRender: Message({
            className: 'general-message',
            kind: Kind.info,
            children: 'Message above all pages',
            hasBackground: true,
        }),
    });
});
```

![Target Page Placement Above](./assets/page-above.png "Target Page Placement Above Example")

## Disabling components

This API allows disabling certain components, which will prevent them from displaying on the page, as well as avoiding any XHR requests or downloaded JS that may be related to the disabled component.

In some scenarios, disabling a component might need some extra CSS added to the page in order to adapt the customized UI to the expected outcome. In order scenarios, components can be disabled from a visual perspective, but XHR requests related to the component will still be executed. This is usually related to replacing a given component with a custom one, while reusing the data retrieved from the backend. More information on this on the [components](#components) section.

As an example, inserting the following code in your LumApps site will disable the Contribution button located on the top bar.

```js
window.lumapps.disable('contribution-button');
```

Before executing the code:

After executing the code:

![After Disabling Contribution button](./assets/after-disable-contribution-button.png "After Disabling Contribution button")


## Changing displayed text

In a specific set of components, developers have the possibility to change the main text displayed on a specific component.

For example, executing the following snippet will change the placeholder displayed on the Search box from `Search` to `Explore`, located at the top bar:

```js
window.lumapps.setText('search-box', {
    en: 'Explore',
    fr: 'Explorer',
    es: 'Explorar'
});
```

## Components

Here you will find the list of all the components that can be customized on LumApps, with the following information:
- Description of the component to customize, and the ID associated to it.
- Whether the component is compatible with the aforementioned features
- Possible use cases for the target.


### Application

| Changing text | No compatibility                                         |

**Note:** Using the `RIGHT` and `LEFT` placements will make the custom component display at either the left top hand side or the right hand side of the application with a `position: absolute;` and either `right: 0;` or `left: 0;`. Furthermore, components will be added as siblings of the main content of the application

| Placements    | Compatible with placements: `LEFT`, `RIGHT` (customizations will be added as siblings of the other navigation items displayed) and `ABOVE`, `UNDER` ( Customizations will be added as siblings of the navigation itself) |
| Disable       | Can be disabled**.                                                                                                             |

**Note:**: Disabling this feature prevents the navigation from being displayed on the site, removing the entire section from your page and avoiding any XHR requests to retrieve the data. Some additional CSS is needed in order to make this customization work as expected

|               |                                                   |

| Changing text | No compatibility                                  |

**Note:** Disabling this feature prevents the navigation from being displayed on the site, removing the entire section from your page, BUT the navigation is still fetched so it can be reused for rendering a custom navigation. Some additional CSS is needed in order to make this customization work as expected

#### Use cases

|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Description   | Target for the entire sub navigation feature of your site *.                                                                   |

| Disable       | Can be disabled.                                                                                                               |
| Changing text | No compatibility                                                                                                               |

**Note:** Disabling this feature prevents the navigation from being displayed on the site, removing the entire section from your page and avoiding any XHR requests to retrieve the data. Some additional CSS is needed in order to make this customization work as expected

|               |                                                  |

| Description   | Target for your site's sub navigation interface. |
| Placements    | No compatibility                                 |
| Disable       | Can be disabled. *                               |
| Changing text | No compatibility                                 |

**Note:** Disabling this feature prevents the navigation from being displayed on the site, removing the entire section from your page, BUT the navigation is still fetched so it can be reused for rendering a custom navigation. Some additional CSS is needed in order to make this customization work as expected

#### Use cases

- [Hide the entire navigation on your site](./use-cases#hide-the-entire-navigation-on-your-site)
- [Create a custom navigation for your site](./use-cases#create-a-custom-navigation-for-your-site)
